# Discord Rules.    
1. No harassment. This includes homophobia, racism, or any other form of hate speech (if they're in the chat or not).    
    
2. No spam. It's a basic rule but a valuable one. Please make sure to not spam as it can disrupt the chat.   
    
3. Consent to our data usage and storage policy. We may store server conversation in #general for up to 7 days at a time to help deal with harassment. The logs are usually cleared before midnight each Friday but if an incident shows up, we will hold that segment of the logs until it's resolved.    
    
4. Remember that you can contact any Student Leader at any time for advice, support or queries. We're here for you.
